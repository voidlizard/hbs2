## The new glorious fixme

This is a new fixme implementation! It's a re-implementation
of fixme aiming for using multiple sources for issues, not
only git repo, and able to share the state via hbs2
privimites.

It will replace the old good fixme and will reuse all the
code from there that could be re-used.

It's indendent to be mostly compatible with the old
fixme, but we will see.

The binary is called fixme-new in order not to be confused
with old fixme, but it's only for a while.

It will be replaced as soon, as this fixme will be fully
operational.
